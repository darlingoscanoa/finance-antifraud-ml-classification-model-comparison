# Finance Anti-Fraud ML Classification Model Comparison

## Description
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs an enhanced feature importance analysis as part of a broader machine learning classification project focused on anti-fraud detection in finance. The notebook visualizes the top features and calculates the cumulative importance of the features using a random forest model.
